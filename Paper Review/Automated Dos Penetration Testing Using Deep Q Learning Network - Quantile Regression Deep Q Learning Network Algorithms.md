## ABSTRACT
```
Penetration test is essential to determine the security level of a network. A penetration test attack path is simulating attack to identify vulnerabilities, reduces likely losses, and contiunuously enhance security. It helps to facilitate the simulation of diffrent attack scenarios as well as it develops the robust security measure and enables proactive risk assessment. We have ombined MulVAL with DQN and QRDQN algorithms to solve the problem of incorrect route  prediction and problematic convergence associated with attack path planning training. As a result of this algorithm. an attack tree is generated, paths within the attack graph are searched for, and then a deep-first search method is used to create a transfer matrix. In addition, QRDQN and DQN algorithms determine the optimal attack path for the target system. The results of this study show that although the QRDQN algorihtm requires more resources and take longer to train then traditional (DQN) algorith, its overall effectiveness in identifying vulenrabilities and optimizing attack path is generally superior to the DQN algorihm. This can lead to better overall performance in real-world penetration testing scenarios.

### 1. Introduction
Recently, network security has been deemed a critical issue that needs to be addressed. Networks connected to the internet are inherently insecure and can be abused by hackers, regardless of whether they are wired or wireless. When data is transmitted, it passes through numerous terminals before reaching its destination, allowing unscrupulous users to intercept or modify it.
