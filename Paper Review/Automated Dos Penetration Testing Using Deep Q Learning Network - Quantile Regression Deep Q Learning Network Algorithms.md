## ABSTRACT
```
Penetration test is essential to determine the security level of a network. A penetration test attack path is simulating attack to identify vulnerabilities, reduces likely losses, and contiunuously enhance security. It helps to facilitate the simulation of diffrent attack scenarios as well as it develops the robust security measure and enables proactive risk assessment. We have ombined MulVAL with DQN and QRDQN algorithms to solve the problem of incorrect route  prediction and problematic convergence associated with attack path planning training. As a result of this algorithm. an attack tree is generated, paths within the attack graph are searched for, and then a deep-first search method is used to create a transfer matrix. In addition, QRDQN and DQN algorithms determine the optimal attack path for the target system. The results of this study show that although the QRDQN algorihtm requires more resources and take longer to train then traditional (DQN) algorith, its overall effectiveness in identifying vulenrabilities and optimizing attack path is generally superior to the DQN algorihm. This can lead to better overall performance in real-world penetration testing scenarios.

### 1. Introduction
Recently, network security has been deemed a critical issue that needs to be addressed. Networks connected to the internet are inherently insecure and can be abused by hackers, regardless of whether they are wired or wireless. When data is transmitted, it passes through numerous terminals before reaching its destination, allowing unscrupulous users to intercept or modify it. A wireless network security standard protects against various threats, such as network compromise, denial of service, data tampering and eavesdropping. To ensure the security of the WLAN, it should fulfill the cyber security standards for confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Confidentiality protects information from unauthorized persons and restricts access to authorized users  only.  For  example,  cryptography  can  encrypt  data  sent  over  a  network  so  that  only  the intended  recipient  can  decrypt  it.  Data  is  encrypted  with  a  secret  key  that  is  only  known  to  the destination and source nodes in symmetric encryption. A secret key is used by the destination to decrypt  the  encrypted  plaintext  when  it  receives  it  from  the  source.  For  integrity,  the  wireless network information must be correct and reliable throughout its lifecycle without being falsified or altered by unauthorized users. In terms of availability, a wireless connection allows registered users to  access  the  site  from  any  location  at  any  time.  If  registered  persons  cannot  access  the  wireless network, this breaches availability and results in an unacceptable customer experience. [2]
