For simple programs such as hello.c, we can rely on the compilation system to produe correct and efficient machine code. However, there are some important reasons why programmers need to understand how compilation systems work:
> Optimizing program performance.
> 	Moder compilers are sophisticated tools that usually produce good code. As programmers, we do not need to know the inner workings of the compiler in order to write efficient code. However, in order to make good coding decisions in our C programs, we do need a basic understanding of machine-level code and how the compiler translates different C statements into machine code.

> Understanding link-time errors.
> 	In our experience, some of the most perplexing programming errors are related to the operation of the linker, especially when you are trying to build large software systems. For example, what does it mean when the linker reports that it cannot resolve a reference? What is the difference between a static variable and a global variable?

> Avoiding security
> 	For many years, buffer overflow vulnerabilities have accounted for the majority of security holes in network and Internet servers. These vulnerabilities exist because too few porgrammers understand the need to carefully restrict the quantity and forms of data they accept from untrusted sources.
